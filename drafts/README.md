# Privacy Pass IETF drafts

This is the working area for the draft materials associated with the Privacy
Pass IETF non-WG. The drafts will correspond to specification made in the
[charter](../CHARTER.md).

## Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the drafts can be built using `make`.

This requires that you have the necessary software installed.  See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md).

### draft-privacy-pass

This draft was presented at secdispatch@IETF106 by Nick Sullivan. The content
will be subsumed by future drafts that will lay out: the protocol, the
architecture; and web integration for Privacy Pass. These drafts will be
arranged into three separate documents.

```sh
$ make draft-privacy-pass
```
